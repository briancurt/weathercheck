# Weathercheck web application
Scrapes data from SMN, Accuweather and Weather Channel for Buenos Aires and displays it in a way I have not defined yet. Uses flask, requests, and beautifulsoup4. Also uses pyvirtualdisplay and selenium for Weather Channel client side processing. Included uWSGI, nginx, and systemd configuration files.

The setup is a mess now, will implement virtualenv or dockerize eventually.
